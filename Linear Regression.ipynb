    "That is, it concerns two-dimensional sample points with one independent variable and one dependent variable (conventionally, the x and y coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system) and finds a linear function (a non-vertical straight line) that, as accurately as possible, predicts the dependent variable values as a function of the independent variable. \n",

    "Multiple linear regression makes all of the same assumptions as simple linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Homogeneity of variance (homoscedasticity): the size of the error in our prediction doesn’t change significantly across the values of the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Independence of observations: the observations in the dataset were collected using statistically valid methods, and there are no hidden relationships among variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In multiple linear regression, it is possible that some of the independent variables are actually correlated with one another, so it is important to check these before developing the regression model. If two independent variables are too highly correlated (r2 > ~0.6), then only one of them should be used in the regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normality: The data follows a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linearity: the line of best fit through the data points is a straight line, rather than a curve or some sort of grouping factor."
